# Elita power distribution
One of the complex part of a boat is the electrical system. The need of a reliable and easy system is great and there exists few power distribution system that is affordable. 

## Background
A newly bought sailboat, *Elita*, has a relative good electrical system, but with very few explanations. 

## Goal
The aim for this project is to simplify the wiring and make it possible for non-expert to troubleshoot the system. It also need to be very safe and must always work. The first part is to only include non-vital system. 

## Outcome 
The outcome is hopefully a reliable and easy system that connects devices and shorten the wiring. 

# System 
*The system will have some requirements and a lot of though.*

## Requirements
- Easy to use
- Lowest voltage drop possible
- No heat issue
- Integrated fuse
- Power meter 
- Easy to debug 
- Input from solar panel
