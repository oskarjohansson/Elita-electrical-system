# Highside Powerdistribution 
A nice, easy-to-use, power distribution card. This will evolve into a motherboard for power distribution. 

## Goal
The main goal is to simplify wiring in a power system and shorter power cables. 

If a system is battery dependent and there is a lot of devices that needs to be switched on and off, there will be a lot cables. A switch need to be in series with the device and often far away from the device. By having a relay board one larger cable to the load and the switches can all have thin and cheap cables. 

## Requirements
- Easy to modify
- Lowest voltage drop possible
- No heat issue
- Integrated fuse
- Power meter 
- Easy to debug
